### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is the purpose of the React Router?
React Router simplifies the implementation of client-side routing in React applications, providing developers with a powerful and flexible way to handle navigation and rendering logic based on the application's URL structure.

- What is a single page application?
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that operates within a single HTML page. Unlike traditional multi-page applications where navigating to different sections or pages typically involves a full page reload from the server, SPAs dynamically update the content of the page as the user interacts with the application, without requiring a full reload.

- What are some differences between client side and server side routing?
Differences between client side and server side routing are: Execution Location, Page Reloads, Initial Page Load, Search Engine Optimization, Complexity and Maintainability

- What are two ways of handling redirects with React Router? When would you use each?
Two common approaches are using the <Redirect> component and using programmatic navigation with the history object.

- What are two different ways to handle page-not-found user experiences using React Router?
Two common approaches include using a dedicated 404 component and utilizing a <Switch> component with a wildcard route. 

- How do you grab URL parameters from within a component using React Router?
In React Router, you can grab URL parameters (also known as route parameters) from within a component by accessing the match object provided by the Route component.

- What is context in React? When would you use it?
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

- Describe some differences between class-based components and function components in React.
Some differences are: syntax, lifecycle methods, state management, and some advanced features.

- What are some of the problems that hooks were designed to solve?
Hooks were introduced to address several pain points and limitations associated with class components and patterns used in React applications.
